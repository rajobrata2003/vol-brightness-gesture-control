# Gesture Control using Mediapipe and OpenCV

This repository contains a project that utilizes Mediapipe and OpenCV to track hand movements and implement gesture controls for changing volume or brightness on a computer.

## Features

- Hand tracking: The project uses Mediapipe's hand tracking solution to detect and track the hand movements in real-time.
- Volume control: The project allows controlling the system volume using predefined hand gestures. For example, moving your index finger together decreases while vice-versa increases volume
- Brightness control: In addition to volume control, it also provides gesture-based brightness control for the computer display.
- Real-time feedback: The program displays visual feedback on the screen, indicating the recognized gestures and the current volume or brightness level.

## How to use
